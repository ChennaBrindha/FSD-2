Aim:
To demonstrate how to create, save, and execute SQL script files in MySQL Workbench to 
create a database, tables, and insert data.
Procedure:
1. Open MySQL Workbench.
2. Click on the “+” icon to start a new SQL tab (or use File > New Query Tab).
3. In the new tab, write SQL code to create a database and table.
4. Save the script by selecting File > Save Script As (e.g., college_script.sql).
5. Click the Execute (lightning bolt icon) to run the script.
6. Refresh the SCHEMAS section to see the newly created database and table.
Script File Content (college_script.sql):
-- Step 1: Create the database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS CollegeDB;
-- Step 2: Use the database
USE CollegeDB;
-- Step 3: Create the 'students' table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (
 id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
 name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
 age INT,
 department VARCHAR(50)
);
-- Step 4: Insert data into the 'students' table
INSERT INTO students (name, age, department) VALUES 
('Alice', 20, 'CSE'),
('Bob', 21, 'ECE'),
('Charlie', 22, 'CSE'),
('David', 23, 'MECH');
How to Save Script in MySQL Workbench:
1. Go to File → Save Script As.
2. Name the file (e.g., college_script.sql) and choose the location.
3. Click Save.
Output:
After executing the script:
 A database named CollegeDB is created.
 A table named students is added.
 4 records are inserted into the table.
You can verify using:
USE CollegeDB;
SELECT * FROM students;
